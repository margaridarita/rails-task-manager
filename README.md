# Rails Task Manager

This was an exercise made at Le Wagon when I started using rails, to undertand Models and CRUD. It is a task list where users can add their tasks. 
I've grabbed this exercise again to practice JavaScript and decided to add the tasks as a checklist, where the user should be able to select several tasks and then delete them by pressing a "complete" button.
However it's still a WIP because the fetch request isn't being correctly transmitted to the tasks controller.
